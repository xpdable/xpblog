# Think of DevOps

Almost ten years ago, when I first heard the word **“DevOps”**, I was working as an automation QA engineer. I was quite unhappy that the idea of combining **Development** and **Operations** seemed to leave **testing** behind.

At that time, my team was responsible for automation testing. Since we followed a **waterfall model** with quarterly releases, we had plenty of time to refine and improve automation before the release. But when release day came, it was always a scramble. Development, QA, and release teams were all under pressure. I still remember the chaos clearly — and I bet many of you have experienced the same. Failed test cases were brought to developers at the last minute. They had to decide whether to fix them immediately or postpone to the next release. Hotfixes were patched, and release engineers rebuilt packages — sometimes this process took hours, and it happened daily during the release phase.

Things started to get better when we made the decision to **decouple several features** from our monolithic architecture. This allowed developers and release engineers to generate **weekly or even daily builds**, so that QA could begin testing earlier. It helped a lot. We had more time to automate test cases for new features and bug fixes, and by the time the formal release came around, most of the verification had already been automated. This was when the DevOps wheel began to turn in my world. Over time, our daily builds evolved into a proper **CI/CD discipline**, and now, automation builds and deploys code even on each commit.

It sounds like a happy ending — but does this really help? What happens when the DevOps process doesn’t actually improve development efficiency?

Let’s step back and look at the bigger picture. As buzzwords like **DevOps** and **DevSecOps** become more mainstream, many companies — especially those going through digital transformations — are quick to adopt them. And while there are countless glowing success stories out there, many of them miss the **core objective**:  
**accelerate the delivery of value, while maintaining high quality and reliability.**

Instead, we hear things like:  
> _“We’ve built a CI/CD pipeline. We’re doing 10 production releases a day. We’re fully practicing DevOps!”_  

But DevOps should never be about doing it for the sake of doing it.

Several years ago, I was leading to define and measure DevOps KPIs at the enterprise level. Naturally, I started with the **4 Key Metrics** (deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and MTTR). But I was caught off guard when management’s first question was:  
> _“Hey, can we increase our deployment frequency? I have to report 100 deployments per month to my boss.”_

That completely missed the point.

I ended up spending a month explaining how to **use metrics fairly and meaningfully**. These metrics are meant to **reflect the performance** of your DevOps practices — not become a target to be gamed. You can improve them by enhancing your CI/CD pipeline, introducing better testing gates, adopting trunk-based development, and more. But doing 100 deployments just to hit a number? That’s just noise.

Even worse, I’ve seen teams being compared against one another purely based on deployment counts.  
> _“Why did the gateway application only release once this month, while the API service released 10 times this week?”_

This kind of pressure often leads to meaningless releases — just to avoid being questioned. I’ve seen teams pushing code with no real changes, just to appear “active.” And what’s the result? Burnout, wasted effort, and increased risk.

This brings us to a deeper problem: **misusing tools without understanding their cost**. When I joined a new project, I immediately noticed our shared Jenkins instance was always jammed. It turned out dozens of teams were running daily builds on it — including many unnecessary or stuck pipelines. Some of them even had manual approval steps **without any timeout**. This wasn’t improving delivery efficiency — it was blocking everyone else.

There are many great technical solutions out there, and DevOps is certainly one of them. But like everything else in tech, **it only works if used properly** — and with the right intention. DevOps is as important as your product architecture, and just as easily misapplied.

There are already tons of tutorials on how to implement CI/CD pipelines. But the **most essential part is the mindset** — how we collaborate, how we improve, and how we deliver value.

**DevOps isn’t about chasing metrics or just implementing tools.**  
It’s about **fostering a culture** of collaboration, continuous learning, and delivering real value to customers with quality and speed. Without the right mindset and purpose, even the best tools and processes become meaningless.

**True DevOps drives teams to work together seamlessly, improve constantly, and focus on what really matters — solving problems and creating impact.**
